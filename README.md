# Landing Page 
This project is a responsive landing page built using HTML and CSS. Includes a responsive and interactive navigation bar. It was more to train my HTML and CSS concepts, I wrote about the Wham! because why not?

📌**Note**: the page is still under development because the 'top 3' block is broken on smaller screens and I haven't been able to fix it yet. 🙁
